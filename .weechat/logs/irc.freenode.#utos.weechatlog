2009-12-08 10:42:47	ketnos	that means I can scroll them :D
2009-12-08 10:43:14	@herlo	ketnos: thx
2009-12-08 10:43:55	@herlo	that's pretty nice
2009-12-08 10:43:58	@herlo	how do you do the scrolling??
2009-12-08 10:45:27	sontek	f9/f10 for title and f11/f12 for userlist
2009-12-08 10:45:55	sontek	I guess those are configurable and I'm going to change them since they conflict with gnome-terminal, I just disabled the gnome term shortcuts for now
2009-12-08 10:46:05	sontek	(never use gnome term ones anyways :P)
2009-12-08 10:50:48	@herlo	sontek: nice
2009-12-08 10:51:15	@herlo	sontek: I don't use Gterm shortcuts either, but didn't ever take the time to disable the keys

2009-12-08 11:07:39	@herlo	Nafai: but how's the job thing going??
2009-12-08 11:07:54	Nafai	Pretty good so far, except I have to mess with PHP stuff. :)
2009-12-08 11:08:00	@herlo	haha, php
2009-12-08 11:08:02	Nafai	Not writing PHP, just packaging it, so not so bad
2009-12-08 11:08:08	@herlo	I mess with that a lot
2009-12-08 11:08:09	Nafai	Just have to read it to understand some config stuff
2009-12-08 11:08:11	@herlo	don't right it either

2009-12-08 11:33:25	burnin	herlo: was looking at the electroregeneration wiki
2009-12-08 11:33:37	burnin	http://electroregeneration.org/wiki/index.php?title=About_Our_Computers
2009-12-08 11:33:50	burnin	"We prefer Ubuntu Linux"
2009-12-08 11:33:52	@herlo	burnin: ahh, yeah.
2009-12-08 11:34:26	@herlo	I will say that we'll have at least fedora and ubuntu disks there, but I don't think I can get some of those systems to install without workign through some fun issues
2009-12-08 11:35:27	burnin	yep, I have a lot of experience working through issues installing Fedora, not so much with Ubuntu.
2009-12-08 11:36:03	@herlo	well, we'll have to convince them :)
2009-12-08 11:36:08	Nafai	Bah
2009-12-08 11:36:17	Nafai	Of course you are used to install issues with Fedora
2009-12-08 11:36:22	Nafai	It's Fedora, after all
2009-12-08 11:36:36	burnin	har har :P

2009-12-08 11:38:08	burnin	though I do need to get more experience with Ubuntu, there are a lot of people using it.
2009-12-08 11:38:22	burnin	and Fedora is very bleeding edge and the releases are short lived.
2009-12-08 11:51:53	burnin	herlo: aside from media would it be worthwile to bring an actual repo from which to perform network installs? I imagine many of these machines will not have DVD drives.

2009-12-08 13:47:03	@undertakingyou	I have a snow blower. It is 15 or 20 years old though. So we get the bulk with that and shovel again right after.
2009-12-08 13:47:16	@undertakingyou	My wife agrees justincarmony, you should share your pizza with us :)

2009-12-08 13:55:34	cro	good move.  Never market on an empty stomach.
2009-12-08 13:57:21	sontek	undertakingyou: My go-to meal when being lazy is stuffed bell peppers

2009-12-12 16:40:10	sontek	undertakingyou: 2 weeks ago I decided to give emacs a chance
2009-12-12 16:40:39	sontek	and although I now have a new appreciation for emacs now that I've learned the ins and outs of it... it has terrible python integration compared to vim
2009-12-12 16:54:10	cro	I was an Emacs user for literally years—I learned it in college in the late 1980s and used it for 20+ years.
2009-12-12 16:54:43	cro	installed every new release that came along.
2009-12-12 16:55:34	cro	I had a brief "fling" with vim at my last job, went back to Emacs, and now am using Vim again since I found the jVi plugin for Netbeans.
2009-12-12 16:58:10	cro	and the MacVim port for Mac OS X
2009-12-12 16:59:03	cro	still have trouble with some things, but I think I am more productive.
2009-12-12 16:59:33	sontek	cro: I only have 1 complaint of emacs and its that it has terrible python integration compared to vim
2009-12-12 16:59:39	cro	yes
2009-12-12 16:59:45	sontek	cro: i'm sure if I messed with it enough, I could get it working the way I want
2009-12-12 17:00:04	sontek	cro: but the community is split, emacs is maintaining one python mode and the python community is maintaining another
2009-12-12 17:00:11	cro	and one of the things that I never could get over with Emacs was that it was so hard to fix stuff like that.
2009-12-12 17:00:33	cro	exactly
2009-12-12 17:45:30	Nafai	sontek: That's kind of weird from my perspective because I've not seen anyone using vim for Python that did much more than syntax highlighting
2009-12-12 17:47:05	Nafai	cro: The reason I use Emacs is thatit seems relatively easy, given you are willing to make the effort, to make Emacs do what you want, because of elisp
2009-12-12 17:47:29	Nafai	sheesh this hotel connection sucks
2009-12-12 17:48:52	cro	Nafai: I just could never make it do what I wanted reliably. :-)
2009-12-12 17:49:08	 *	Nafai nods
2009-12-12 17:49:39	Nafai	I've been using Emacs for a decade, and using vim for very quick editing things during that same time and I can't ever imagine using vim seriously
2009-12-12 17:49:59	cro	yeah, I felt that way too.
2009-12-12 17:50:45	cro	Then I caught someone's blog post about Vim where they described it as being like having a tricked-out first-person-shooter game controller for editing text.
2009-12-12 17:51:04	cro	after years of messing with it the light sort of went on for me.
2009-12-12 17:51:40	cro	OTOH the other reason I sort of left Emacs was the chording key combinations were making my RSI flare up.
2009-12-12 17:52:08	cro	and I truly am glad I know both
2009-12-12 17:52:23	cro	since no matter where you edit text, there are often bindings for either Emacs or Vi
2009-12-12 17:52:32	Nafai	Yeah
2009-12-12 17:53:02	sontek	Nafai: you never read my blog post on vim and python then ;)
2009-12-12 17:53:17	cro	sontek: Got an URL, I'd like to read it.
2009-12-12 17:53:33	Nafai	sontek: well, I was at that presentation, I guess.  But you are the only one I've seen with that set up and it still isn't quite the same for me.
2009-12-12 17:53:51	sontek	cro: http://sontek.net/post/Python-with-a-modular-IDE-(Vim).aspx
2009-12-12 17:53:59	Nafai	Frankly, I don't think I would have the editing experience I would like with Python anywhere but that is Python's fault, not the editor
2009-12-12 17:54:37	sontek	Nafai: yeah, I tried giving emacs a shot, and i'm sure it does support what I want, its just the community is so divided and not well documented on python stuff
2009-12-12 17:54:59	Nafai	I got spoiled with the exactness of the navigation and completion and such in Eclipse or IDEA for Java and that's kind of the gold standard for me
2009-12-12 17:55:06	sontek	Nafai: code completion was really lacking in emacs + python, where as I felt it was much better with vim
2009-12-12 17:55:11	Nafai	It's difficult to get that right with Python because of dynamic typing
2009-12-12 17:55:23	Nafai	sontek: I haven't experienced the problems you've had, sorry I've been too buy to help
2009-12-12 17:55:47	Nafai	s/buy/busy/
2009-12-12 17:55:47	infobot	Nafai meant: sontek: I haven't experienced the problems you've had, sorry I've been too busy to help
2009-12-12 17:55:54	Nafai	But I think with recent efforts that have gone on, I can get Emacs to meet that gold standard for Haskell
2009-12-12 17:56:56	sontek	Nafai: yeah, the dynamic typing gives issues, I solved that in vim with a mix of rope, ctags, and just simple buffer completion
2009-12-12 17:58:25	sontek	Nafai: yeah, I would love using a full IDE like eclipse with PyDev, but I think the familiarity of one editor is more beneficial than meeting the full gold standard
2009-12-12 17:58:40	sontek	especially if you change languages as much as we do :p
2009-12-12 17:59:09	Nafai	:)
2009-12-12 17:59:46	sontek	Nafai: I think the problems I'm having are just problems with dynamic python, which I solved in vim already, and don't feel like doing again in emacs :P
2009-12-12 18:00:26	sontek	I do love the ability to launch a python prompt inside emacs though
2009-12-12 18:00:28	sontek	thats pretty nice
2009-12-12 18:02:20	sontek	the real reason I wanted emacs though was for Org mode :P
2009-12-12 18:02:32	sontek	I figured if it was good at python and org mode I'd be in heaven
2009-12-12 18:24:05	Gate	anyone direct me to a decent howto to unencrypt files that were encrypted by the "encrypt your home directory" option in Ubuntu?
2009-12-12 18:30:53	burnin	http://www.brighthub.com/computing/linux/articles/8958.aspx
2009-12-12 18:31:22	burnin	sudo mount -t ecryptfs ~/mountpoint ~/encryptedfs
2009-12-12 18:31:23	burnin	maybe?
2009-12-12 18:32:07	burnin	I have that backwards
