2009-12-15 23:24:26	Jerub	he means 2.4
2009-12-15 23:24:37	Jerub	2.3 is dict() + list comprehension.

2009-12-15 23:26:16	Mercator	BitWraith: when I need to do that I usually just go dictionary = dict([(key, value) for something in something]), which creates a dictionary

2009-12-16 01:42:20	razor_2k1	hey guys python noob here .....just wondering how u set precision?
2009-12-16 01:42:32	jorrit	Precision of what?
2009-12-16 01:42:39	amoffat	MindVirus, maybe as a suggestion, if you can find where exactly it is breaking, you might be able to regex-fix it before passing it to BS
2009-12-16 01:42:45	razor_2k1	floating point
2009-12-16 01:42:50	razor_2k1	variable
2009-12-16 01:42:53	jorrit	razor_2k1, you can't.
2009-12-16 01:43:01	jorrit	razor_2k1, you can control precision for output however.
2009-12-16 01:43:01	razor_2k1	omg seriosuly?
2009-12-16 01:43:19	MindVirus	amoffat: People around here cringe at seeing "regex" and "HTML" in the same page of chat logs.
2009-12-16 01:43:27	razor_2k1	so i get an output of 8.5

2009-12-16 01:43:35	razor_2k1	i want it to be 8.50 theres no way to do this?
2009-12-16 01:43:45	jorrit	razor_2k1, look at what I said.
2009-12-16 01:43:50	jorrit	razor_2k1, you can control precision for output.
2009-12-16 01:43:51	rjcarr	razor_2k1: yeah, you can control the printed output
2009-12-16 01:43:56	hylje	float precision depends on the size of the number the float contains
2009-12-16 01:43:58	jorrit	razor_2k1, i.e. when printing to screen or converting to a string.
2009-12-16 01:44:01	amoffat	razor_2k1, "%.2f" % number
2009-12-16 01:44:04	razor_2k1	ok continue

2009-12-16 02:52:32	ronny	jorrit: there is no spec about what methods of file use each other, and there is also iter(file)
2009-12-16 02:52:33	jorrit	forbjok, who is now creating that file object?
2009-12-16 02:53:46	forbjok	ronny: yes, i could do that, but then i'd have to implement a lot of other stuff as well, or create wrapper methods for it the just calls the underlying object anyway. possible, but a bit messy. if i could derive it, i would need no code other than the readline() method

2009-12-16 06:07:42	jorrit	purefusion, well apparently you are now at a point that you need to go down that route.
2009-12-16 06:07:46	magicblaze0073	any ideas on how to fix this "easy_install lxml"? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/157363/
2009-12-16 06:07:54	purefusion	I need a quick fix to hold me over, and maybe there's a benefit in learning the wrong way of doing things... so I know why not to do them
2009-12-16 06:08:00	ikanobori	purefusion: If you want to know on why not to use threads in Python you can read up on the Global Interpreter Lock.
2009-12-16 06:08:20	ikanobori	purefusion: Threads are extremely difficult to debug, Python itself is not fully thread safe, hence the GIL, your program won't get any speedups.
2009-12-16 06:08:23	ikanobori	Why use them?

2009-12-16 06:08:51	eggy_	magicblaze0073: you need to install them. What OS are you on?
2009-12-16 06:09:00	magicblaze0073	installing them now, opensuse.

2009-12-16 06:09:32	magicblaze0073	shouldnt it check and report these...anyways, both are installed now.
2009-12-16 06:09:32	eggy_	purefusion: sure. But you don't necessarily need twisted, you need an event loop

2009-12-16 06:29:26	cosmodad	I'm trying to use property() to create a simple getter/setter pair. However, this example won't work and I don't know why: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/157371/
2009-12-16 06:29:27	cosmodad	Can anyone take a quick look please?
2009-12-16 06:29:27	shylent	eggy_: this is most weird, if I use len in IDLE I get the correct values for non-ascii

2009-12-16 06:30:08	mino	eggy_: no i think this is the first step
2009-12-16 06:30:13	jorrit	cosmodad, line 13 is never called I think.
2009-12-16 06:30:27	jorrit	or it is...
2009-12-16 06:30:41	eggy_	shylent: probably a different python interpreter
2009-12-16 06:30:43	mino	eggy_: first i need a flat homedir list and then i need to traverse them down ( i think these are different things)
2009-12-16 06:30:47	cosmodad	jorrit: I think it is because the getter works
