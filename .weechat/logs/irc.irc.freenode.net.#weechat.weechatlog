2009-12-16 06:58:29	sontek	Is there a /lastlog type command in weechat?
2009-12-16 06:59:05	sontek	and how can I have it not re-order what channels have activity? Like right now it says "Act:5,1,4" I'd like it to say "1, 4, 5"
2009-12-16 06:59:09	xt	sontek: there's a  script for it
2009-12-16 06:59:14	Emralegna	test
2009-12-16 06:59:16	xt	there's an option for that
2009-12-16 06:59:19	xt	for buffer order
2009-12-16 06:59:34	xt	lastlog script is called egerp
2009-12-16 06:59:39	xt	*egerp
2009-12-16 06:59:41	xt	*egrep
2009-12-16 07:00:55	sontek	xt: I tried telling it not to re-order hotlist, I thought that was the option to do it but its not
2009-12-16 07:01:10	sontek	weechat.look.hotlist_sort
2009-12-16 07:01:20	xt	sontek: /help weechat.look.hotlist_sort
2009-12-16 07:01:20	sontek	I used group_number_asc
2009-12-16 07:03:34	sontek	xt: it doesn't really have good /help, no real description other than 'hotlist sort type'
2009-12-16 07:04:02	sontek	but its definitely not the right now since I'm using group_number_asc and its still sorting all weird
2009-12-16 07:04:29	sontek	xt: thanks for the egrep script :)
2009-12-16 07:04:35	xt	number_asc is what you want
2009-12-16 07:04:40	xt	group by number, ascending
2009-12-16 07:05:08	xt	group_ is for grouping different types of hotlist types, like privmsg, chanmsg
2009-12-16 07:05:08	drubin	true that.
2009-12-16 07:12:21	sontek	nice :)
2009-12-16 07:12:31	sontek	now where do I put these scripts so they autoload?
2009-12-16 07:12:41	sontek	is there an ~/.weechat/scripts folder or anything?
2009-12-16 07:14:51	@FlashCode	in ~/.weechat/<language>/autoload/
2009-12-16 07:15:00	@FlashCode	see quickstart/doc
2009-12-16 07:15:16	xt	sontek: you isntall them with weeget, which does it for you automatically
