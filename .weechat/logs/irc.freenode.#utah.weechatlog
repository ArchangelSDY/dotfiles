2009-12-08 09:15:45	+goozbach	jnbek|wc: I've been planning on an upgrade, but I had such a long irc session running I didn't want to quit

2009-12-08 09:18:16	+goozbach	they're configurable
2009-12-08 09:18:22	ketnos	they interfere with gnome terminal defaults as well
2009-12-08 09:18:45	jnbek|wc	yea, I'm too busy writing autoaway scripts and rhythmbox announcers to learn how to remap keys, lol
2009-12-08 09:19:37	ketnos	ok I'm in love with weechat though

2009-12-08 09:31:18	eightyeight	heh
2009-12-08 09:33:18	ketnos	i'll have to figure out how its windowing/buffering works later
2009-12-08 09:33:21	ketnos	but this looks promising
2009-12-08 09:33:29	jnbek|wc	eightyeight: they've revamped the plugin API considerably, and things are alot more customizable.

2009-12-08 11:49:34	+elg	for more background, I'm asking because last night I swear I heard some surround effects coming out of the surround speakers while watching numb3rs
2009-12-08 11:49:50	+elg	but it was a brief fleeting moment and I couldn't convince myself it was true surround
2009-12-08 11:50:08	+elg	the receiver does do dolby pro logic II which does pseudosurround from stereo sources.
2009-12-08 11:50:14	+elg	so maybe that's what I heard.
2009-12-08 11:55:43	levi	Could be.  I think that's pretty common, since surround systems have been available for a lot longer than multichannel audio encoding on TV.

2009-12-08 14:46:42	TehLaser	There seems to be an inverse relationship between the priority flag and actual, well, priority.
2009-12-08 14:47:02	TehLaser	Generally anything marked high priority can be safely deleted unread.  :)
2009-12-08 14:50:08	+goozbach	redbeard2: got any good snickerdoodle recipies?
2009-12-08 14:50:20	+goozbach	I think I want to try and make lumperdoodles next
2009-12-08 14:50:24	+elg	take your wife's snicker and your child's doodle, mix in a pot
2009-12-08 14:51:26	levi	goozbach: This is the one we use: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/mrs-siggs-snickerdoodles/detail.aspx
2009-12-08 14:52:21	+goozbach	how good would a snickerdoodle be if it weren't flat and crisp
2009-12-08 14:52:27	+goozbach	but thick and chewy?
2009-12-08 14:52:56	levi	These ones are flat but chewy.
2009-12-08 14:53:33	eightyeight	mulicheng: why?
2009-12-08 14:53:41	eightyeight	mulicheng: so far, mutt is not behaving
2009-12-08 14:54:28	mulicheng	Mainly imap syncing problems.
2009-12-08 14:54:34	eightyeight	hmm
2009-12-08 14:54:52	eightyeight	when i ran it on f11, it was consuming massive amounts of cpu, just idling
2009-12-08 14:54:56	mulicheng	for instance, suppose you don't want to sync an account., tb3 you had to specify the option for every folder in the account
2009-12-08 14:55:21	mulicheng	but the problem was, to specify the option, you had to click on the folder, which started downloading the messages.
2009-12-08 14:55:24	eightyeight	isn't it just caching the headers though? wouldn't that provide speed improvements?
2009-12-08 14:55:27	mulicheng	stuff like that.
2009-12-08 14:55:31	mulicheng	perhaps they fixed it better.
2009-12-08 14:56:00	mulicheng	I don't know much about it personally, my boss has ranted about it a few times.
2009-12-08 14:56:08	mulicheng	I'm still on TB2.
2009-12-08 14:56:19	mulicheng	haven't installed an upgrade.
2009-12-08 14:56:32	eightyeight	speaking of muas, anyone know why mutt would complain about a bad gpg passphrase, when it's not entered incorrectly?
2009-12-08 14:56:39	mulicheng	but every other week he mentions something else about why TB3 is driving him crazy again.
2009-12-08 14:57:13	eightyeight	when i ran it, other than the cpu problem, it wal f11 that was driving me nuts, not tb3
2009-12-08 14:57:20	eightyeight	but then again, it _was_ beta then

2009-12-09 09:19:20	tensai	every other app was working correctly. gnome-terminal would drop characters or insert extra ones.

2009-12-09 09:21:46	sinuhe	xterm has always worked for me.  The one thing it doesn't have, tabbing, is easily solved with screen.

2009-12-09 09:24:13	 *	sinuhe notes that he uses unicode with xterm
2009-12-09 09:25:37	JoshH	gnome-terminal, xfce terminal, etc are fine if you like using tabs and just need one terminal window at a time, customize the settings a lot, etc, but if you have multiple displays covered with terminals logged into various things, etc, they get a bit heavy and slow.  also, i could never get gnome-terminal to switch irssi windows with alt + arrow keys, which bugged me.
2009-12-09 09:26:18	 *	Sargun_Screen is using xfce.
2009-12-09 09:27:59	 *	jnbek|wc also uses xfce, pretty much exclusively.
2009-12-09 09:28:23	JoshH	i use xfce at home and gnome at work, but rxvt-unicode everywhere

2009-12-09 12:32:48	Migs	Airmile hackers figured out that they could buy dollar coins (free shipping!) from the US Mint, using credit cards that gave them airmiles for purchases. Then they took the dollar coins straight to the bank and deposited them, paying off the credit card bills before any interest was incurred. The only cost was gas for the bank-runs.

2009-12-09 12:41:48	Nafai	I wish our Chase card had decent rewards, it's really nice.  We have an automatic transaction set up to automatically pay the balance in full every month, and it just deducts the amount from our checking account.

2009-12-09 12:44:06	levi	Even without the 0% introductory rate, its interest rate is better than a used car loan from the same company.  Plus it's a rewards card, too.
2009-12-09 12:47:04	levi	Hmm, no, inflation is still negative.  Oh well, I guess we'll have to wait a bit longer for financial armageddon.

2009-12-10 10:38:07	mp_	i use mint. it doesn't integrate particularly well with america first, unfortunetely.
2009-12-10 10:38:29	mp_	if it did though, i'd be more inclined to use it.
2009-12-10 10:39:41	tristanbob_	mp_, I thought america first bragged about their online presence
2009-12-10 10:39:57	mp_	their in-house web presence is very good
2009-12-10 10:40:09	mp_	i don't know why mint is broken with AF
2009-12-10 10:40:32	tristanbob_	I was surprised that "weber state credit union" was in there, and it attempted to connect (failed)
2009-12-10 10:41:39	Nafai	mint works okay, but I want more precise categorization of transactions
2009-12-10 10:41:58	Nafai	For example, if I go to walmart, some of it is groceries, some of it is prescriptions, etc
2009-12-10 10:42:08	Nafai	So I just do it by hand with a tool called ledger
2009-12-10 10:42:16	tristanbob_	Nafai, I agree.  I created some new catagories, but I wonder if it learns when I change the category it used.
2009-12-10 10:42:47	tristanbob_	btw - I just discovered the "yes" command.  Not really as exciting as it sounds.
2009-12-10 10:43:03	Nafai	heh
2009-12-10 10:43:08	tristanbob_	yes "This is so cool! Just like basic"
2009-12-10 10:43:10	Nafai	Is that equivalent to "true" ?
2009-12-10 10:43:19	tristanbob_	nope - man yes
2009-12-10 10:44:41	Nafai	heh
2009-12-10 10:44:53	Nafai	Wow, it's the equivalent of:
2009-12-10 10:44:58	Nafai	10 PRINT "y"
2009-12-10 10:45:01	Nafai	20 GOTO 10
2009-12-10 10:45:04	Nafai	in a single command!
2009-12-10 10:45:42	thesuperbigfrog	tristanbob_:  for opensuse you do practically any and all configuration in YAST;  try running yast2 from the command line
2009-12-10 10:46:55	thesuperbigfrog	all of the config is very GUI in opensuse
2009-12-10 10:47:25	tristanbob_	thesuperbigfrog, problems is this is a virtual appliance running JeOS
2009-12-10 10:47:29	tristanbob_	so no yast
2009-12-10 10:47:49	Nafai	No /etc/hostname in OpenSuSe?
2009-12-10 10:48:03	tristanbob_	Nafai, sadly no
2009-12-10 10:48:17	tristanbob_	is there any suse gurus here?
2009-12-10 10:48:35	Nafai	Not I, thank goodness
2009-12-10 10:48:54	Nafai	I guess I'd do this to find out:
2009-12-10 10:49:20	Nafai	sudo find /etc -exec grep $(hostname) {} \; -print
2009-12-10 10:49:23	Nafai	Or somesuch
2009-12-10 10:52:06	thesuperbigfrog	ah
2009-12-10 10:53:09	TehLaser	Is there any reason to do that instead of "grep -r $(hostname) /etc" ?
2009-12-10 10:53:26	 *	TehLaser has weak find skillz, so he's not entirely sure what's going on there.
2009-12-10 10:53:56	Nafai	Oh, you know, probably not.  I'm just so used to doing it the find way because I often add a search for just specific file types
2009-12-10 10:54:22	Nafai	TehLaser: It's doing exactly what your command will do.
2009-12-10 10:55:18	TehLaser	I tend to use for instead of find for that, just becuase the find syntax is so inscrutible.
2009-12-10 10:55:52	Nafai	It can be cryptic once you start adding various conditionals and such
2009-12-10 10:56:06	TehLaser	"for file in *.txt; do echo $file; grep $whatever $file; done;" sort of things.  I abuse the hell out of that pattern.
2009-12-10 10:59:24	thesuperbigfrog	tristanbob_: is there a file /etc/HOSTNAME ?
2009-12-10 10:59:29	JoshH	i think suse has /etc/HOSTNAME
2009-12-10 10:59:53	JoshH	yet another reason to avoid that crappy dist
2009-12-10 11:00:02	tristanbob_	ls: cannot access /etc/hostname: No such file or directory
2009-12-10 11:00:26	tristanbob_	JoshH, I use Ubuntu, but SuseStudio is so powerful I want to use it to create a custom Linux appliance
2009-12-10 11:00:28	thesuperbigfrog	can you create it? (guessing)
2009-12-10 11:00:57	JoshH	seriously though, it should be there, in all caps
2009-12-10 11:01:04	JoshH	unless something is weird
2009-12-10 11:01:47	tristanbob_	I"m going to ask in #suse
2009-12-10 11:02:24	Nafai	JoshH: Why in the world do they make it all caps?  I've never seen it that way on any other distro.
2009-12-10 11:03:23	thesuperbigfrog	suse without yast is just asking for a goose chase when config needs changing
2009-12-10 11:04:10	Nafai	The way you talk, it must be like editing the Windows registry with DEBUG.COM. :)
2009-12-10 11:04:58	JoshH	i have no clue Nafai
2009-12-10 11:07:49	tristanbob_	echo mynewhostname > /etc/HOSTNAME
2009-12-10 11:09:16	Nafai	So if HOSTNAME doesn't it exist it just defaults to localhost or something?
2009-12-10 11:10:31	JoshH	i didn't know that susestudio existed, but what's better about it than ubuntu studio?
2009-12-10 11:11:04	tristanbob_	Nafai, my hostname is "linux"
2009-12-10 11:11:27	Nafai	JoshH: Different thing.  Susestudio is a tool to make custom distributions, basically.
2009-12-10 11:11:30	Nafai	AIUI
2009-12-10 11:11:33	JoshH	ah, ok
2009-12-10 11:11:48	JoshH	i can't imagine why anyone would want to use a distro derived from suse, but whatever
2009-12-10 11:12:07	Nafai	The demo I saw a year or so ago at UTOS was pretty slick
2009-12-10 11:12:10	Nafai	But, I agree :)

2009-12-10 11:20:27	+elg	wow, plug has totally jumped the shark.
2009-12-10 11:20:35	+elg	not a single post on how evil FB is trying to steal everyone's privacy
2009-12-10 11:20:51	+elg	glad to see irc hasn't ;)
2009-12-10 11:21:31	+elg	IMHO (which is not the opinion of my employer or sjansen's reindeer, blah blah), the wizard is a bit unfortunately worded but it's definitely a net win
2009-12-10 11:22:03	+elg	if you changed the defaults, then the recommendation is to keep your settings. if you didn't, you get this thing in your face that says guess what your stuff has been and will be less private than you wanted.
2009-12-10 11:22:19	+elg	and now you have per-item privacy
2009-12-10 11:22:50	+elg	and the whole privacy settings are less complex but still flexible
2009-12-10 11:23:33	+elg	all of which i think will end up with more net privacy for everyone, although of course there's the desire to encourage people to share where they feel comfortable doing so
2009-12-10 11:25:11	+elg	the eff blog post yesterday is a fair assessment I think, though we've changed some things already in response to that.
2009-12-10 11:26:38	sjansen	elg: Are you implying you'd appreciate me bringing the topic up on PLUG?
2009-12-10 11:27:08	+elg	I'd give basically the same speel, perhaps moderately edited, in response
2009-12-10 11:27:21	sjansen	Perhaps I could imply that FB is killing mentors by selling private data to proprietary top-posting software vendors.
2009-12-10 11:27:29	+elg	i wouldn't be hurt or excited one way or the other, but it surprises me that something so obviously flamewar-worthy hasn't been brought up yet.
2009-12-10 11:27:34	+elg	:-D
2009-12-10 11:27:55	+elg	or if not flamewar-worthy, at least conspiratorial fodder
2009-12-10 11:28:07	tristanbob_	elg, I like the improvments, so I can decide who gets my posts (by using friend groups)
2009-12-10 11:28:17	sjansen	elg: Why does Facebook hate America's freedom?
2009-12-10 11:28:18	+elg	yes, it's totally awesome
2009-12-10 11:28:30	tensai	the per-post privacy settings is a total win
2009-12-10 11:28:36	+elg	i've been using it for probably 2 months now and it is as awesome as you think it is
2009-12-10 11:28:44	tensai	letting friends list be public data is not
2009-12-10 11:28:44	+elg	friend lists need to be easier to manage though
2009-12-10 11:29:01	+elg	and they need a LRU friendl ists list in the drop-down
2009-12-10 11:29:16	+elg	your set of friends has never been private
2009-12-10 11:29:31	+elg	and, that's one of the things we responded to from the eff post
2009-12-10 11:29:39	+elg	we now give you an option to hide friend list from search
2009-12-10 11:29:52	+elg	though it's still not private, it's secure by obscure
2009-12-10 11:29:53	+elg	the way it was before
2009-12-10 11:30:09	+elg	note that "your set of friends" != your set of friend lists
2009-12-10 11:30:38	+elg	that would be a totally evil thing to make public. then fozzmoo and von would know they're on my "libertarians - do not open on bad days" list.
2009-12-10 11:31:10	sjansen	I thought fozz was a mootarian.

2009-12-10 12:16:26	Nafai	I heard it was really slow, did it seem that way to you?
2009-12-10 12:16:37	levi	So, while I was in San Jose a while ago, I went to Fry's.  They had a little display with 7 or 8 e-book readers out for you to examine.
2009-12-10 12:16:38	Nafai	Did you try it at a local B & N?  I want to see one.
2009-12-10 12:16:55	levi	They were *all* broken in some way.  You couldn't page through a book on any of them.

2009-12-10 12:17:13	thesuperbigfrog	As a Kindle owner, I would be interested to see how the Nook compares
2009-12-10 12:17:51	Nafai	I want an ebook reader
2009-12-10 12:18:00	Nafai	But I'm not too keen on the Kindle
2009-12-10 12:18:02	Nafai	DRM and all
2009-12-10 12:18:19	levi	I want one, but I don't want to pay for one.  So, if anyone wants to give me a present... ;)
2009-12-10 12:20:09	Nafai	heh
2009-12-10 12:20:53	+elg	couldn't page through?
2009-12-10 12:21:03	+elg	isn't that like the primary use case?
2009-12-10 12:21:09	tristanbob_	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XLshEBvYdw
2009-12-10 12:21:42	thesuperbigfrog	Nafai: you'd be hard-pressed to find an ebook reader that does not suppot DRM features
2009-12-10 12:21:47	tensai	jsmith-training: what did you play? checkers? soccer? I hear they can be sore losers.
2009-12-10 12:22:18	Nafai	thesuperbigfrog: sure, "support", but the Kindle is particularly heinous
2009-12-10 12:22:33	thesuperbigfrog	The Kindle supports DRM, but only for ebooks bought through Amazon
2009-12-10 12:22:34	Nafai	Besides, Amazon is selling all of their music DRM free
2009-12-10 12:22:46	Nafai	I don't see why they have to make their books with DRM
2009-12-10 12:22:47	jsmith-training	tensai: Read parts of Dracula, downloaded the "Count of Monte Cristo" from Google Books, and played with the media player
2009-12-10 12:23:13	jsmith-training	Nafai: It was a *bit* slow, but nothing like I had read about on the web
2009-12-10 12:23:50	thesuperbigfrog	If the content owner wants DRM, and most do, Amazon has to comply with the content owner's demands if they want to sell the ebook
2009-12-10 12:24:22	thesuperbigfrog	The Kindle will also support non-DRMed formats
2009-12-10 12:25:02	thesuperbigfrog	I personally think that Amazon would do DRM-free ebooks if they could, just as they have with MP#
2009-12-10 12:25:06	thesuperbigfrog	MP3
2009-12-10 12:25:23	+elg	kindle does pdf now, right?
2009-12-10 12:25:41	Nafai	finally
2009-12-10 12:25:42	thesuperbigfrog	for all kindle except 1st gen
2009-12-10 12:26:11	levi	Except you can't zoom, apparently.
2009-12-10 12:26:20	+elg	that's good, but it's a bit ominous that it didn't to begin with
2009-12-10 12:27:04	thesuperbigfrog	PDF isn't the ideal format because it isn't reflowable
2009-12-10 12:27:58	thesuperbigfrog	most ebook formats are based on HTML, so there really isn't a hard concept of pages / page size like PDF has
2009-12-10 12:27:58	levi	I don't think there is an ideal format for e-books.
2009-12-10 12:28:07	+elg	it's not ideal, but it's the de facto standard for non-drm ebooks that exist in the wild
2009-12-10 12:28:14	+elg	or one of the top players anyway
2009-12-10 12:28:21	levi	Sometimes, the page layout and formatting is important.  Sometimes reflow is important.
2009-12-10 12:28:36	 *	jsmith-training tends to agree w/ levi 
2009-12-10 12:28:47	+elg	not supporting it means you don't care about free material
2009-12-10 12:28:57	jsmith-training	I wish epub had better support for formatted text
2009-12-10 12:29:22	tensai	I wish epub would give me a cookie. I like cookies.

2009-12-10 12:50:09	Nafai	The kindle indeed looks awesome
2009-12-10 12:50:33	Nafai	But I'm not sure if I can compromise given the control Amazon has over it (not a monopoly, but things like the 1984 incident)
2009-12-10 12:50:46	+maquis	meh...
2009-12-10 12:50:50	+maquis	most of my books aren't from amazon
2009-12-10 12:51:06	+maquis	got a few of the google books, but most of the stuff i've got on there is from manybooks.net
2009-12-10 12:51:22	Nafai	Oh nice
2009-12-10 12:51:33	Nafai	I've done a little reading on my G1, but the screen is just a little too small
2009-12-10 12:51:53	Nafai	For example, I re-read most of Real World Haskell on it (when I was too lazy to dig out the book after moving)
2009-12-10 12:52:01	Nafai	It made reading code a bit difficult, but it wasn't too bad
2009-12-10 12:52:37	+maquis	the majority of the amazon books i have on my kindle are either free books (offered for a limited time to get you interested in a particular author/series) or indie books (most of which are not drm'd, and which are usually pretty good and priced < 3$)
2009-12-10 12:52:47	Nafai	good to know
2009-12-10 12:52:54	+maquis	i'm cheap
2009-12-10 12:53:07	+maquis	i consider 9$ to be very expensive for a book...
2009-12-10 12:53:24	+maquis	paid it for pirate latitudes... and going to pay 8$ for under the dome...
2009-12-10 12:53:31	+maquis	but other than that, i usually avoid anything over 5$
2009-12-10 12:53:51	JoshH	do you get an amazon discount?
2009-12-10 12:54:14	+maquis	JoshH: not a particularly good one... we get 10% off, up to 100$ off per year
2009-12-10 12:54:24	JoshH	well, that's better than some
2009-12-10 12:54:33	JoshH	overstock.com has no employee discount at all
2009-12-10 12:54:34	+maquis	don't think it actually applies to kindle books, though
2009-12-10 12:54:43	+maquis	at least, i've never seen it applied to my kindle books
2009-12-10 12:54:49	JoshH	i did a stint there back in 2003 and it sucked
2009-12-10 12:55:01	+maquis	i have an amazon credit card, though, so i get 25$ gift certificates pretty regularly
2009-12-10 12:55:04	+maquis	:)
2009-12-10 12:55:18	+maquis	and i use swagbucks.com for searches, so i get 5$ gift certificates regularly from there
2009-12-10 12:55:24	+maquis	and i buy most of my books using those
2009-12-10 12:56:45	fozzmoo	Nafai: :-D

2009-12-10 14:42:57	Migs	I wouldn't do it
2009-12-10 14:43:05	Migs	then again, I don't have an HD TV
2009-12-10 14:43:24	levi	I have both an HD TV and a BluRay player now.
2009-12-10 14:43:50	levi	And two whole BluRay discs.
2009-12-10 14:44:50	levi	sjansen: Why would I be excited about this SPICE thing?
2009-12-10 14:45:47	fozzmoo	RH is paving the way to making SPICE an open standard.
2009-12-10 14:46:08	levi	I would only care about that if I cared about SPICE.
2009-12-10 14:46:12	fozzmoo	Anyone who wants to be involved in the development of the standard can, like any open source project.
2009-12-10 14:46:39	fozzmoo	levi: Then you would not be excited about this SPICE thing.
2009-12-10 14:47:05	levi	I'm asking what's interesting about SPICE, not what's interesting about open source.
2009-12-10 14:47:31	sjansen	I haven't seen it in person, but supposedly SPICE can efficiently stream HD video from a VM to a client without skipping.
2009-12-10 14:47:47	tensai	levi: SPICE is exciting because when combined with SALT and HEAT it makes FOOD better.
2009-12-10 14:48:00	@Jayce^	and it makes your eyes *really* blue
2009-12-10 14:48:09	@Jayce^	but it's really just worm poop
2009-12-10 14:48:20	levi	The spice must flow!
2009-12-10 14:49:42	sjansen	Unlike VNC, supposedly SPICE doesn't suck. Unlike Citrix, SPICE is no longer proprietary.
2009-12-10 14:50:23	+goozbach	and *THAT*'s what makes it awesome
2009-12-10 14:50:26	levi	So SPICE is supposed to be a way for a thin client to connect to a remote VM on a server?
2009-12-10 14:50:36	fozzmoo	http://www.spice-space.org/features.html
2009-12-10 14:52:38	+elg	levi: would you pay $4/month to rent a single blu-ray from a local store whenever you jones for hd?
2009-12-10 14:52:45	levi	OK, now SPICE is interesting.
2009-12-10 14:53:28	fozzmoo	http://www.spice-space.org/docs/spice_for_newbies.pdf
2009-12-10 14:53:45	fozzmoo	Lots of diagrams in that PDF that don't seem to scream "newbie."
2009-12-10 14:53:49	levi	elg: Maybe.  The whole Netflix value proposition has gone out the window for me, though, as I never watch movies anymore.
2009-12-10 14:54:18	+elg	in that case, cancel netflix altogether and spend $4-$12/mo at a local store. problem solved :)
2009-12-10 14:54:41	fozzmoo	I plan to do the Netflix streaming thing.
2009-12-10 14:54:55	levi	elg: My wife still uses it, but she still watches stuff on VHS, so I don't think she'd care about BluRay.
2009-12-10 14:55:20	Migs	at least VHS doesn't have all the problems DVDs have with scratches, skipping, etc.
2009-12-10 14:55:32	fozzmoo	I recently stopped in a store to watch a blueray of Monsters Inc. on an HD TV.
2009-12-10 14:55:47	@Jayce^	we use the netflix streaming a bit...
2009-12-10 14:55:49	fozzmoo	The experience was indeed reminiscent of 10 years ago when I first say DVD video.
2009-12-10 14:55:59	fozzmoo	s/say/saw/
2009-12-10 14:55:59	@ibot	fozzmoo meant: The experience was indeed reminiscent of 10 years ago when I first saw DVD video.
2009-12-10 14:56:09	levi	It just has the problems of crappy picture, crappy audio, waiting forever for rewinds, degradation of video quality over time, etc.
2009-12-10 14:56:10	@Jayce^	has a bunch of the kids-shows we can toss on in those times you just need them to sit down for a bit
2009-12-10 14:56:11	+elg	yeah, I've totally never screamed at a VHS tape and threw it to the floor because it just puts out snow or a continually v-hold screwed up picture or distorted audio
2009-12-10 14:57:07	levi	Jayce^: I have my DVR regularly recording and keeping the last 4 or 5 episodes of various PBS kids shows just for that purpose. :)
2009-12-10 14:57:21	+elg	ditto, but i only keep 1 or 2
2009-12-10 14:57:21	Migs	sounds more like a temper thing than a VHS thing
2009-12-10 14:57:25	@Jayce^	yeah, I have a pretty big archive, but they have shows that I don't get...
2009-12-10 14:57:28	+elg	but they come on more than daily
2009-12-10 14:57:44	@Jayce^	my daughters seem to love *wubzy*    ..... gag

2009-12-10 14:58:29	levi	My kids like Curious George, Word World, Super Why, Dinosaur Train, etc.
2009-12-10 14:58:47	@Jayce^	yo gabba gabba
2009-12-10 14:58:55	@Jayce^	that show really freaked me out at first
2009-12-10 14:59:01	+goozbach	I started fraggle rock on netflix streaming last night
2009-12-10 14:59:09	mulicheng	levi: Netflix value went away for us too.  We watched all the movies we were interested in.. now our queue is empty so I put the account on hold.
2009-12-10 14:59:13	+elg	i outlawed super why and my wife doesn't like word world
2009-12-10 14:59:15	@Jayce^	goozbach: classic

2009-12-10 14:59:47	mulicheng	Our problem is that we're generally disinterested in movies.
2009-12-10 14:59:53	levi	elg: It's a new PBS one.  It's got a UofU Paleontologist on it, apparently.
2009-12-10 15:00:13	@Jayce^	like I just went through Hogans Heroes.... that's a lot of discs to get over time

2009-12-10 15:11:16	fozzmoo	unum: Like AuthorizeNet?

2009-12-10 15:11:57	levi	Heh.  It's easy to go wrong in the diet soda world.
2009-12-10 15:12:03	+goozbach	sjansen: I see your problem... it's a *DIET*
2009-12-10 15:12:24	+goozbach	I'd imagine Jayce^ has some experience of that

2009-12-10 15:14:17	fozzmoo	Oh, gee, I really don't know about costs. I've just worked on the code. :)
2009-12-10 15:15:22	unum	well then I'll ask my other question.  it's transparent to the user then(ie not like paypal or google checkout)
2009-12-10 15:15:30	fozzmoo	It can be.
2009-12-10 15:15:43	fozzmoo	Most of the payment processors have at least a couple different modes.
2009-12-10 15:15:52	 *	mp_ develops theory that wikis encourage terrible software documentation
2009-12-10 15:16:13	fozzmoo	You can do the actual payment on the processor's site...
2009-12-10 15:16:24	fozzmoo	or you can do the payment on your site and submit it to the processor behind the scenes.
2009-12-10 15:18:16	@Jayce^	unum: costs depend entirely on how big you are, what you sell, and how you sell it
2009-12-10 15:18:25	 *	sjansen counters with the theory that wikis result in at least some software documentation where before there wouldn't have been any
2009-12-10 15:18:25	fozzmoo	unum: http://developer.authorize.net/api/
2009-12-10 15:18:45	@Jayce^	it's a racket really, and everything is negotiable, but always in their favor
2009-12-10 15:18:50	fozzmoo	:)
2009-12-10 15:19:03	mp_	i accept that theory but counter with the theory that just because it's present doesn't mean it isn't terrible
2009-12-10 15:19:19	+elg	anyone have opinions on roof racks? one from the mazda dealer is like $400 which seems insane.
2009-12-10 15:19:32	fozzmoo	Yeah- Dealer options are always insanely expensive.
2009-12-10 15:19:47	fozzmoo	elg: Talk to a nice bike shop.
2009-12-10 15:19:50	levi	They are expensive no matter where you get them from, but $400 is probably not the cheapest you can get.
2009-12-10 15:19:53	+elg	then i see stuff on amazon for as low as $50 or $100, and oem not-from-mazda-but-specific-for-mazda5 that are like $200-$300
2009-12-10 15:19:54	unum	apparantly I left the hoa board meeting a little to early on tuesday
2009-12-10 15:20:04	levi	Everything at a nice bike shop is also insanely expensive.
2009-12-10 15:20:12	fozzmoo	levi: good point.
2009-12-10 15:20:15	@Jayce^	and then the mounting is always a lot from a dealer... there will be a lot of aftermarket shops that do better deals
2009-12-10 15:20:19	unum	I'm put a website up on my server for them, so then I get an email telling me to add online payments by january 21st
2009-12-10 15:20:25	+elg	so i wonder what the important factors to consider are when it comes to roof racks
2009-12-10 15:20:39	@Jayce^	look for places that do window-tinting, custom wheels, or truck mods..
2009-12-10 15:20:42	+elg	especially since i've never had a roof rack that didn't come with the vehicle or a roof that I cared about.

2009-12-10 15:21:40	@Jayce^	unum: there are lots of gateways out there, and if you are big enough, you can do direct-processor or bank (but I don't think you would be, that's really big)
2009-12-10 15:21:56	levi	You probably want to consider the accessories that go along with the actual rack.
2009-12-10 15:22:06	@Jayce^	there are several places that they charge you, you gotta have plenty of people going over the paperwork and such
2009-12-10 15:22:15	levi	Such as mounting hardware for bikes/skis/cargo boxes, locks, etc.
2009-12-10 15:22:46	@Jayce^	elg: for an example, I'm getting rails added to my truck shell so I can put the yakima racks on it..  not a full rack though
2009-12-10 15:23:08	@Jayce^	and I'm getting rails that are for the yakima ends I have, the ones that can go in a cars rain-gutters
2009-12-10 15:23:13	levi	Yakima and Thule are the major systems, IIRC.

2009-12-10 15:25:35	@Jayce^	ARB avoids having to have a "full" billing system, and you don't need nearly as much PCI work
2009-12-10 15:25:42	@Jayce^	though you are really locked in with them
2009-12-10 15:26:08	@Jayce^	elg: if you google, you'll find all the big catalogs carry aftermarket ones, you can do yourself..

2009-12-10 15:28:32	tensai	elg: it's a scam. all you really need is some towel racks from home depot and a spool of duct tape.
2009-12-10 15:29:38	@Jayce^	that worked for the clampett-mobile tensai, but now he's in calIforny, and has to look the part

2009-12-10 15:31:58	levi	elg: Also note that you can often get genuine Mazda parts from online Mazda dealers way cheaper than your particular local dealer.
2009-12-10 15:33:50	levi	I sometimes buy Miata parts from this place, which is selling the 5's roof rack for $300: http://www.finishlineperformance.com/store/product.php?productid=16828&cat=279&page=2

2009-12-10 15:38:48	levi	They make special ski attachments for racks, but you could just tie them on if you wanted to.
2009-12-10 15:40:42	levi	elg: Looks like the Mazda rack is made by Thule, so you could put any Thule attachment on it.
2009-12-10 15:53:04	+elg	i wonder about one of these

2009-12-10 15:53:30	fozzmoo	I have something like that.
2009-12-10 15:54:04	levi	I can't imagine it would be good for the finish on your roof to put it up there without a rack.
2009-12-10 15:54:22	@Jayce^	I've got one (and have one that busted)
2009-12-10 15:54:24	@Jayce^	worked well
2009-12-10 15:54:33	tensai	eggyknap: did I ever mention I got an instance of bucardo running? wasn't too difficult.
2009-12-10 15:54:46	@Jayce^	levi: ours had a soft bottom, didnt' cause any issues
2009-12-10 15:55:19	levi	Definitely cheaper than a rack, but it won't help for bikes/surfboards/etc.
2009-12-10 15:55:30	eggyknap	tensai: w00t ;)
2009-12-10 15:55:35	@Jayce^	right, but just extra space when going on a trip, it's good
2009-12-10 15:56:10	@Jayce^	used our on the legacy quite a few times, but was hard because sub's don't have normal window edges to grab on to
2009-12-10 15:56:22	+elg	yeah, i can get a rack later when i get into surfing. if i can find a rack solution with confidence for $150 i'll probably do that, otherwise i'll go with the bag
2009-12-10 15:56:54	@Jayce^	elg: we've used the bag even with a roof rack.  keep things dry
2009-12-10 15:57:30	+elg	true that.
2009-12-10 15:57:55	levi	I doubt you're going to find a *good* rack system for $150.
2009-12-10 15:58:04	@Jayce^	yeah
2009-12-10 15:59:12	levi	Racks are just expensive.  You're going to pay at least $200 for the bars/mounts, and then probably at least another $100 for equipment-specific mounting gadgets, and maybe another $50 for locks, etc.
2009-12-10 15:59:26	@Jayce^	yup
2009-12-10 15:59:48	levi	Thus, I have never had a nice rack on a car. ;)
2009-12-10 16:00:08	@Jayce^	that's why I'm just getting gutter rails instead of buying truck specific racks, even though my yakimas are coming on 20 years old
2009-12-10 16:00:38	levi	I was shocked at how much I had to pay to put a trailer hitch on my van and get a hitch-mount bike rack.
2009-12-10 16:00:53	@Jayce^	levi: where'd you get the hitch?
2009-12-10 16:01:08	+elg	metal stuff is expensive
2009-12-10 16:01:10	@Jayce^	I've found before that u-haul actually had some of the best after-market hitch install deals for cars
2009-12-10 16:01:22	@Jayce^	at least at the time it was
2009-12-10 16:01:31	fozzmoo	I bought the hitch for my Subaru through checker and installed it myself.
2009-12-10 16:01:50	fozzmoo	Correction- the HITCH RECEIVER. :)
2009-12-10 16:01:56	levi	Jayce^: The first one I got from e-hitch, and they sent me crap that didn't work together.  The mounts were from one hitch, and the crossbar was from another one.
2009-12-10 16:02:33	levi	The second one I bought from an online Eurovan parts place on sale.

2009-12-11 11:33:29	harleypig	I'm looking for a compressed air blower to clean my laptop of dust ... I know I can by canned air, but it occurs to me that someone must have made a mini electric blower so you don't have to constantly be buying cans of compressed air.
2009-12-11 11:33:36	harleypig	Anyone know of anything like that?
2009-12-11 11:34:30	harleypig	I've tried searching for 'compressed air' and 'mini blower' on amazon and froogle and not found anything

2009-12-11 11:47:07	harleypig	heh
2009-12-11 11:48:03	thesuperbigfrog	you could just get a small shop vacuum that has a blower feature.  It would be useful for other types of cleaning too
2009-12-11 11:51:11	levi	Or you could just buy canned air.

2009-12-11 11:53:00	thesuperbigfrog	that works for a little while, but eventually, a vacuum is the best solution.  Case in point, Spaceballs.
2009-12-11 11:53:29	harleypig	You mean a giant robot maid is better for cleaning the dust out of  your computer stuff?

2009-12-11 11:54:03	thesuperbigfrog	if you can get one yes, but the giant robot maid will still use a vacuum cleaner
2009-12-11 11:54:18	levi	harleypig: Sure, I saw your initial message, but you seem to be balking at the price of the alternatives.
2009-12-11 11:54:26	harleypig	tensai: I have to buy 2-3 cans every month.

2009-12-11 11:55:49	thesuperbigfrog	I think your best bet is a small shop vacuum that has a blower feature.  A good brand will probably last you longer than a smaller specialty electronics vacuum/blower and would also be useful for other types of cleaning

2009-12-11 12:55:24	sjansen	Signing a petition telling him he's still not doing enough is not the same thing as voting for his removal.
2009-12-11 12:56:35	Nafai	sjansen: I would guess that many who sign this petition are not necessarily the same group that would vote for his removal just now.

2009-12-11 12:57:03	Nafai	Even though he is continuing some Bush policies, I still wouldn't compare him to Bush and Cheney who I vastly disagreed with and I would have loved to have seen removed.
2009-12-11 12:57:42	eightyeight	who said anything about his removal?
2009-12-11 12:58:37	sjansen	I'm just taking your objection to the logical extreme.
2009-12-11 12:59:01	levi	I think what sjansen meant is that signing this petition does not indicate a general disapproval of Obama, just a specific desire for him to follow through with a promise.
2009-12-11 12:59:19	eightyeight	i would think the petition would be more effective in listing what has been done so far, and what is left to do
2009-12-11 12:59:50	eightyeight	people like being validated, rather than just criticized
2009-12-11 13:00:10	levi	Computer guys suck at that, though.  We like to insult people. :P
2009-12-11 13:00:12	sjansen	Those people shouldn't go into politics.

2009-12-14 14:17:32	levi	They only want musicians to make money through them.  Musicians making money through other means is something they don't want at all.
2009-12-14 14:17:33	+maquis	just like publishers are fighting ebooks despite (due to) the fact that authors are making a larger percentage of the money from ebooks than pbooks
2009-12-14 14:18:32	+maquis	(publishing through the kindle store, an author gets 35%, if they publish through smashwords, they can get 42%...  if they go through a standard publisher, they get around 10-12%)
2009-12-14 14:19:34	unum	what about copyrights
2009-12-14 14:19:52	+maquis	unum: what do you mean?  what's your question?
2009-12-14 14:20:14	unum	if you go through a standard publish you typically have to sign over your copyrights(unless you are a big name)
2009-12-14 14:20:43	+elg	i saw a blog comment the other day that was concerned about ward photo directories because of copyrights on the photos
2009-12-14 14:21:00	+elg	makes one gag
2009-12-14 14:21:25	levi	Don't you generally have someone take photos specifically for the directory?
2009-12-14 14:21:41	unum	it's been that way in all the wards I've been in
2009-12-14 14:21:53	unum	which I think makes it essentially a work for hirer
2009-12-14 14:22:01	+maquis	unum: actually, a lot of the time, the contract doesn't include ebook rights
2009-12-14 14:22:16	fozzmoo	Most ward directories also have a disclaimer that contents are not to be used for anything other than Church-related purposes.
2009-12-14 14:22:29	levi	My current ward has (or had, anyway... haven't seen it in a while) a scrapbook with a submitted family picture of each family.  I guess some of those might be copyrighted.
2009-12-14 14:22:35	+maquis	ebook rights are handled separately from pbook rights (although random house has been attempting to claim that they have ebook rights for books that they didn't negotiate them for, but the courts have been siding against random house so far)
2009-12-14 14:22:40	unum	maquis: right, so the publisher(who holds the copyright) can sell it as an ebook and not pay the author
2009-12-14 14:22:52	+maquis	unum: no... the publisher doesn't have the copyright
2009-12-14 14:23:01	+maquis	they have a contract to sell the book as a pbook
2009-12-14 14:23:02	unum	maquis: more often than not they do
2009-12-14 14:23:10	+maquis	this is why lots of old books can't be sold in ebook right now...
2009-12-14 14:23:40	unum	there are cases of both
2009-12-14 14:24:13	+maquis	true... there are some cases where the publisher owns copyright, but i think they actually can only purchase it for a certain length of time before it returns to the author
2009-12-14 14:24:41	unum	that would sound like an exclusive license not ownership
2009-12-14 14:24:48	unum	but I don't really know all my legal terms
2009-12-14 14:25:07	+maquis	i know one of the big problems with getting books available in ebook format has been the fact that the majority of books written > 15 years ago but are not in public domain don't have any ownership of the ebook rights
2009-12-14 14:25:38	+maquis	those ebook rights have to be negotiated fresh now, and that's slowing down the process of releasing all those books in ebook format...
2009-12-14 14:25:53	+maquis	(also slowing it down is the digitization of those books, but that's a separate issue)
2009-12-14 14:27:01	unum	it makes sense that were a license was issued there would be a dispute about who has what rights
2009-12-14 14:27:06	+elg	that's why we should only read new material. old material can't be trusted. so archaic.
2009-12-14 14:27:10	+maquis	there was a case where random house tried to sue a small ebook publishing company because the author had created a contract to release their ebook through the ebook company although they had the pbook published through random house
2009-12-14 14:27:18	+elg	probably full of bothersome facts too
2009-12-14 14:28:01	sjansen	Without bothersome facts, how will we teach our children about Benedict Arnold and George W Bush?
2009-12-14 14:28:06	+maquis	the courts threw the case out, and made it very clear that if it came back, they would side with the author and ebook publishing company...  random house backed down really quickly and settled out of court because they didn't want to set any legal precedent against them
2009-12-14 14:28:46	+maquis	anyway... gotta go do some stuff...  but publishing companies are pretty annoying to me right now :P
2009-12-14 14:28:57	unum	they always annoy me :)
2009-12-14 14:29:03	unum	death to big industry!!
2009-12-14 14:29:10	+elg	sjansen: they'll write their own blogs redefining every hero/villain in ways that are convenient to their own political biases and agendas.
2009-12-14 14:29:15	+elg	that's the beauty of new media.
2009-12-14 14:29:52	unum	I'd say the old media has already done that
2009-12-14 14:30:12	unum	have you read a us history text book?
2009-12-14 14:30:24	+elg	but new media puts it in the hands of amateur history rewriters
2009-12-14 14:30:29	+elg	everyone writes his own history!
2009-12-14 14:30:53	+elg	no more do we have to depend on history book authors to rewrite history for us. no more are we shackled by a limited number of historical perspectives.
2009-12-14 14:31:12	unum	well yes, but somehow that bothers me less than only the powerful writing history
2009-12-14 14:32:32	+elg	exactly. which is why we need to avoid the facts that leaked through the powerful's attempts to rewrite history
2009-12-14 14:32:57	unum	well obvisouly
2009-12-14 14:33:15	+elg	amateur history rewriters aren't skilled enough to make a compelling case that flies in the face of facts. unless we unburden ourselves they won't be able to leave a lasting mark
2009-12-14 14:33:22	+elg	no matter how effective they are at stirring things up today.
2009-12-14 14:33:22	unum	this time I say the phillipines invaded and occupied the US for 40 years instead of the other way around
2009-12-14 14:33:39	+elg	that would explain phillidelphia.

2009-12-15 12:47:42	brasto	my heavens, why on earth does Debian (even the latest) not come with less and dig installed by default?  Isn't that pretty basic?  I'm surprised they have vim if they don't have those...
2009-12-15 12:55:03	sontek	brasto: Do they have a default pager at all?
2009-12-15 12:55:20	sontek	I use vim everyday, dig is special use, so I can see why they'd not include it
2009-12-15 12:55:34	sontek	but they should have some pager, even if its not your preferred less
2009-12-15 12:58:05	JoshH	it doesn't come with a full vim version either, you need to apt-get install vim, even on ubuntu
2009-12-15 13:04:14	JoshH	of course, ubuntu probably expects people to use nano or gedit only
